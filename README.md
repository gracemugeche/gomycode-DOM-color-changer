# Interactive Color Changer 🎨

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the **Interactive Color Changer** project! This simple web application allows users to dynamically change the background color of a box by clicking a button. The color is generated randomly using a JavaScript function that creates a hexadecimal color code.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **basic web development** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
